Ciao and welcome to my blog! I'm so glad you're here. My name is Camilla and I'm a 30-year-old Italian who moved to Switzerland for my studies and eventually settled here as a Machine Learning Engineer. Through this platform, I'm excited to share my experiences, knowledge, and insights with a like-minded community.

As an expat living in Switzerland, I've had the opportunity to immerse myself in a diverse culture and engage with a dynamic international community. I'm passionate about exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and experiencing unique perspectives. I believe that these experiences have enriched my life and broadened my horizons, and I'm eager to share my thoughts and adventures with you.

In addition to my professional career as a Machine Learning Engineer, I have a wide range of hobbies and interests. From skiing in the Swiss Alps to cooking up delicious Italian recipes, from practicing 3D modeling to dabbling in various forms of art, I'm constantly seeking new experiences and learning along the way. I'm excited to share my insights, tips, and discoveries on these topics and more with my readers.

As a firm believer in the power of community and the value of shared knowledge, I'm excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts and learners through this blog. I believe that we all have something to offer and take from each other, and I'm committed to creating a space that fosters meaningful conversations and mutual learning.

Thank you for joining me on this blogging journey. I look forward to sharing my adventures, insights, and passions with you, and I'm eager to learn from your perspectives and experiences as well. Grazie mille for visiting my blog, and let's embark on this exciting adventure together!
